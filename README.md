This is just a repo for skins build with [CustomPlayerModels](https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels). By default it puts things in gists, but you can use repos if you manually encode things, and this saves a lot of space!

Skins are located in the branch called 's', since it's part of the URL.
